# CodinGame

## Team

Valentin - Thinker, Gamer & Code reviewer
Shirish - DEV environment & Code
Thilo - Code

## Strategy

1. Set-up DEV environment prior to game
2. Two people play quickly in the beginning while the third checks that whole flow works
3. Once the basics are clear discuss the strategy

## Let's start!

1. Clone project
2. Push one line to the README 
3. Set-up CodinGame external code editor

### How to use an external code editor
